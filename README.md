# SQL-Employee_Challenge-9
 
All these querys work and provide the information asked for.  I feel the relationship between the databases could be better, for example the title id in titles is equal to the emp_title_id in employees but that relationship is not established in this version.   So I hope to update this assignment with better relationships after another review.
